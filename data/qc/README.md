Output from the pre-imputation quality control step (invoked using `./check_strand.sh`) are placed in this directory. These include:
* `plots/` - a subdirectory of allele frequency plots
* `strand_summary.txt` - a quality assessment of the data across all chromosomes, pre- and post-strand-alignment
* `strand_info_n.txt` - a more detailed breakdown of allele frequencies, for each of `n` chromosomes
